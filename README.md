# Playing-With-AI

This repository contains three simple Python programs created with the assistance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet for an assignment in the AI-Receptive Software Development course. Each program demonstrates basic game development or utility creation using the Pygame library.

## Projects

### 1. Calculator

A simple graphical calculator application built with Pygame. It provides basic arithmetic operations and a user-friendly interface.

**Features:**
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Clear function to reset calculations
- Error handling for division by zero

**File:** `/Calculator/main.py`

### 2. Tic-Tac-Toe

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation using Pygame. Play against a computer opponent that makes random moves.

**Features:**
- 3x3 game board
- Player vs. Computer gameplay
- Win detection and tie game handling
- Option to play again after each game

**File:** `/TicTacToe/main.py`

### 3. To-Do List

An enhanced To-Do List application with a graphical interface built using Pygame.

**Features:**
- Add, remove, and mark tasks as completed
- Separate display for completed tasks
- Scrollable task list
- Clear completed tasks functionality

**File:** `/ToDo/main.py`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-generated-python-games.git
```
2. Install the required Pygame library:
```
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

Navigate to each project's directory and run the `main.py` file:
```
cd Calculator
python main.py
```
```
cd ../TicTacToe
python main.py
```
```
cd ../ToDo
python main.py
```
